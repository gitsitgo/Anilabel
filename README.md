Anilabel
========

Anilabel a small lightweight Winform program designed for the sole purpose of relabeling Anime videos. Anilabel is built to do the work for you... no double clicking, no moving of your text cursor here and there, no copying and pasting. Best of all, it will do its best to relabel videos **for** you.

Context
-------

This project was born out of the frustration of organizing anime files of various sources, subbers, and quality. Usually, subbing groups are pretty consistent, but even so they have done their best to get your attention by placing \[PROUD SUBBER GROUP\] at the beginning of every file. What's worst is that some files are named inconsistently with spaces being replaced with underscores, double spaces here and there, different tag types, etc... It makes for a hard time when you just simply wanted to order the videos in your explorer to pick the next video to watch.

Features
--------

![Anilabel](/README/anilabel.jpg "Anilabel Interface")

Anilabel is built on a regex parsing design algorithm to retrieve and gather information about your anime. It is a *best effort* engine that expects anime files to be somewhat formatted already. It will try to parse various formats and if it believes that something is wrong with the relabelled anime, it will highlight the title in red for you to manually relabel.

Other features are summarized below:
*	Browse or drag and drop videos you want to relabel into one form interface
*	Relabel in different default formats while seeing Anilabel relabel it
*	Hide format parts that you don't want to include
*	Automatically clean up unnecessary tags and duplicate spacing characters
*	Option to output videos to a single folder location \(case usage: when you have scattered anime of the same series all over your computer\)
*	Optimized for file move operations \(compared to regular cut and paste\)

Notes
-----

Anilabel is intended for usage with anime videos. It will probably work for other video files as well, but with less success. I'd be happy if you have any comments/feedback/suggestions/requests/usage reports :\).
